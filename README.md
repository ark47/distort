# distort
Distorts a SVG.

Goal:
Allow a user to upload/insert a SVG. Then allow that user to randomize a defined amount of the coordinates of that SVG's path.

Intent:
Similar to a random color picker sparking inpsiration when an artist/designer is in a rut. This attempts to inspire new ideas via randomizing a SVG.
